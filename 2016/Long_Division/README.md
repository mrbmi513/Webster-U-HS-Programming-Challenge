# Long Division
Source file: `divide.{c, cpp, java}`

Input file: `divide.in`

The students in Ms. Smith’s class of linguistically gifted 2nd graders are struggling again. This time they need help with long division problems.

Ms. Smith was so impressed with your work the last time that you volunteered to help, that she is asking for your assistance again. Ms. Smith wants you to write a program that, given a dividend and divisor, displays the
quotient and remainder. She hopes that when students see your long division program, they will better
understand the meaning of their homework problems.

In the expression `13 ÷ 5 = 2 remainder 3`

13 is called the dividend,

5 is called the divisor,

2 is called the quotient, and

3 is called the remainder

## Input
Input is two integers dd and dv ( 2 ≤ dd, dv ≤ 1,000,000 ) representing the dividend (dd) and the divisor (dv), separated by a single space.
## Output
Output the correctly solved long division problem as "dividend / divisor = quotient R remainder" with a single space between each value and symbol.

As with all contest problems: No trailing spaces at the end of any output line.

As with all contest problems: End the final output line with a new line symbol.
## Test Case
**Input**
```
13 5
```
**Output**
```
13 / 5 = 2 R 3
```
