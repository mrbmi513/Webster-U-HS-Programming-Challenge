# Number Perfection
A “Perfect Number” is one for which the sum of all its positive divisors, excluding itself, is equal to the number.  For example,
**28** is a perfect number since it has positive divisors **1, 2, 4, 7, 14**, and the sum of these divisors is **28**.

Write a program that will read a number from a data file and determine whether the input value represents a perfect number.

Data file: `PerfectNumber.dat`


## Sample Runs

Input: 	
`28`

Output: 	
`28 is a perfect number`

Input: 	
`36`

Output:<br>
`36 is not a perfect number`
