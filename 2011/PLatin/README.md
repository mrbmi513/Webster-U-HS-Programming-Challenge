# PLatin
To keep his award-winning soup recipes private, a master chef has come up with a new language called PLatin. You must write a program that will translate a sentence into PLatin. Each word should be changed as follows:
+ All the letters before the first vowel in the word should be moved to the back of the word
+ If the word begins with a vowel, the letter “p” should be placed at the beginning of that word
+ The 2 letters “ay” should be added onto the end of a word.

Note that the modifications should be done in the order specified.

The input file will consist of a single line of characters, all lowercase letters, with a single space separating adjacent words. Each word will contain at least one vowel. Your program should display the PLatin translation of the input.

Data file: `PLatin.dat`      Save program on: `PLatin.cpp(.java)`

## Sample Run
Input:
`all of latin words are wrong`

Output:
`pallay pofay atinlay ordsway pareay ongwray`
