# Even Numbers
You are to be given two integers, the first one smaller than the second, and are required to display all even integers that lie in the range of those two integers from the smaller to the larger.  If one or both of the input integers are also even, they must be included in the output.

The first line of the input file contains an integer, n, representing the number of problems to be solved.  There are then n more lines, each containing two integers.  You may assume that the first integer on each line is smaller than the second.  For each pair of integers display the even numbers between them, as described above.
