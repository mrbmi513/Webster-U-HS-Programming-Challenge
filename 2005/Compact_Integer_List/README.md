# Compact Integer List
A list of integers is transformed into *compact form* by moving all instances of 0 as far to the right as possible while preserving the order of the other numbers. For example, given integers, `5 1 6 0 8 3 0 7 0 5`, the compact form is, `5 1 6 8 3 7 5 0 0 0`.

Your task is to write a program to perform this transformation.  The input file contains 10 integers.  The program should display the transformed version of this list.

Data file: `Transform.dat`

## Sample Run

Input: 	
`1 0 4 3 4 0 1 5 0 4`

Output: 	
`1 4 3 4 1 5 4 0 0 0`
